# MGt315FoodDeliveryApp


The aim of the project was to create an application in the MVC architecture that would meet the following business requirements:

- The owner of a restaurant can create an account on a food ordering portal to offer his services.
- The owner of a restaurant can define his menu, i.e. specify the food category (appetizers, soups, courses, desserts) and enter a description of the item along with the price.
- For each of the given items, the owner of the restaurant can upload a photo to the application to make it easier for the customer to choose.
- The owner of a restaurant can provide a list of streets to which he delivers food.
- The customer can create an account.
- The customer can provide a street address and the application will display a list of restaurants offering the possibility of ordering food delivered.
- The list of premises is to be paginated and sorted.
- The customer can choose a restaurant and see its menu.
- The customer can place an order by selecting how many and what items he wants to order.
- The customer can see the confirmation of the placed order based on the generated order number.
- The customer may cancel the order if less than 20 minutes have passed since it was placed.
- The owner of the restaurant can see the orders, divided into pending and completed.
- The owner of the premises indicates that the order has been completed.
